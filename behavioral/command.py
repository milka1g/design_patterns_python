"""
Command is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request. 
This transformation lets you pass requests as a method arguments, delay or queue a request’s execution, and support undoable operations.
The Command pattern can turn a specific method call into a stand-alone object. This change opens up a lot 
of interesting uses: you can pass commands as method arguments, store them inside other objects, switch 
linked commands at runtime, etc.
Use the Command pattern when you want to queue operations, schedule their execution, or execute them remotely.
Use the Command pattern when you want to implement reversible operations.
How to: 
1) Declare the command interface with a single execution method
2) Start extracting requests into concrete command classes that implement the command interface. Each class must have a set of fields 
for storing the request arguments along with a reference to the actual receiver object. All these values must be initialized via the 
command’s constructor.
3) Identify classes that will act as senders. Add the fields for storing commands into these classes. Senders should communicate with 
their commands only via the command interface. Senders usually don’t create command objects on their own, but rather get them from the client code.
4) Change the senders so they execute the command instead of sending a request to the receiver directly.
5) The client should initialize objects in the following order: 
    - Create receivers.
    - Create commands, and associate them with receivers if needed.
    - Create senders, and associate them with specific commands.
