"""
Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a library, 
a framework, or any other complex set of classes.
Use the Facade pattern when you need to have a limited but straightforward interface to a complex subsystem.
Use the Facade when you want to structure a subsystem into layers.
How to:
1) Check whether itâ€™s possible to provide a simpler interface than what an existing subsystem already provides. 
2) Declare and implement this interface in a new facade class. The facade should redirect the calls from the client code to appropriate objects of the subsystem. 
3) To get the full benefit from the pattern, make all the client code communicate with the subsystem only via the facade. 
4) If the facade becomes too big, consider extracting part of its behavior to a new, refined facade class.
